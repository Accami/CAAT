----------

* Added proper touch events support.
* Added behaviorStarted method to behavior lifecycle listener.
* Added calculateKeyframesData method to get a CSS3 keyframes representation of any given behavior.
* Added CSSKeyframeHelper methods to manage CSS3 @-[webkit|moz]-keyframes elements.
* Fixed bug on setZOrder method which created a nested actor array.
* Added setTimeOffset method on behaviors which allows to start a behavior at any given position instead of zero time.

11/08/2011
----------

* Added statistics to CSS director.
* Fixed a bug that prevented a button-as-actor to set its first state image.

11/07/2011
----------

* Enabled multi-page packed textures on GL renderer.
* Fixed GL lines color with the new UNPACK_PREMULTIPLY_ALPHA_WEBGL flag to be compatible with FF.

11/02/2011
----------

* Fixed FF Webgl textures problem. Unpacking pre multiplied alpha on channels has done it.
  Changing from blending function SRC_ALPHA to ONE.
* Added Box2D debug renderer.
* Fixed Demo3, sprite fish didn't animated properly.

10/27/2011
----------

* Added minified and non-minified CAAT library files versions.

10/26/2011
----------

* Changed Input subsystem (again). Now every event has the right information.
* Changed Transformation matrix hierarchy. Now Director's transformation is considered to be Projection Matrix.
* Changed Actor's setScaleAnchored and setRotationAnchored methods so that anchor values are no more
  coordinates in space but proportional values (0..1) representing a percentage (like in behaviors).
  This is a major issue and should be taken into account for previous developments.
* Fixed tutorials and demos to reflect setScaleAnchored and setRotateAnchored changes.

10/24/2011
----------

* Fixed CSS dragging bug.
* Added get/set id methods to CSS Actor.

10/19/2011
----------

* Code optimizations.
* Fixed bug with onMouseMove local coordinates.

10/18/2011
----------
* Added a callback function to be triggered on Director resize events. The method enableResizeEvents signature
  has been changed to be enableResizeEvents : function(mode, onResizeCallback) {}. The parameter
  onResizeCallback is function with the signature function( director, width, height ).
* If director has enableResizeEvents enabled, now is resized on first instance. Previously, a window resize
  had to be triggered manually.
* Fixed mousemove coordinates on scaled director that weren't proper ones.

10/17/2011
----------

Fixed input subsystem. Now Actor instances won't receive mouseUp if dragged was performed on them.
BUG. Fixed a bug with container behaviors that prevented a contained behavior to be expired again.


10/15/2011
----------

Fixed a bug with bezier bounding box that wasn't including the curve's first control point. (thanks yodesoft.com)


10/14/2011
----------

Added modelToModel coordinate system conversion method which transforms a local coordinate into another
actor's coordinate system.


10/13/2011
----------

Refurbished input subsystem. Now handles drag on buttons.
Added scene pause methods.
Added line definition values on Shape and Star actors.
Added visual debugging info, regarding FPS and total/active actors on screen. (CAAT.DEBUG=1 before
director creation).


09/26/2011
----------

Added ShapePath to allow for rectangle shaped path segments.
Added methods on Path* and bezier curves to manage individual control points.
Added bounding box support for Path* objects.
Changed Path.closePath function semantics.
Fixed some code on rectangle, point, bezier, path.


09/14/2011
---------

Added shift/control/alt modifiers to key events.
added missing getAnchorPercent method to actorCSS.js file. [important bug]
Fixed CSS renderer zOrder error.


09/11/2011
----------

Added function setInteractive method to PathActor.
Added function showBoundingBox : function(show, color) to PathActor.


09/04/2011
----------

Removed bug on ActorCSS.setFillStyle().
Deprecated methods setFilled and setOutlined form CAAT.StarActor.


09/01/2011
----------

Added new layout module. Now simply lays out a collection of actors in a row into a given container.
Will upgrade accordingly as needed.


31/08/2011
----------

deprecated method centerOn and renamed it to centerAt.


16/08/2011
----------

Added x and y attributes to mouseEvent object instances.


15/08/2011
----------

Added a exception to be thrown whenever an Actor is to be added to any given parent and already has
 a registered parent.
Added on actor destroy event, a call to be removed from its parent (in case there's one). Now, discardable
 and out-of-frame-time elements can be succesfully reused with the previous condition. To remove an
 actor means a linear search to identify in which position is stored.


13/08/2011
----------

Fixed director canvas resize on RESIZE_PROPORTIONAL. WebGL renderer did not show properly after resizing.
Changed directorGL perspective from frustum to orthogonal.


11/08/2011
----------

Updated tutorials to fit new CAAT needs.
Updated demo/examples to fit new CAAT needs. Suggested place to look for examples is CAAT-Samples repo.

Fixed some scene transition bugs (when scaling).


10/08/2011
----------

Added on ActorCSS needed control to set a canvas as background image. It is not recommended
 since the performance drops very significantly.

Fixed director's RESIZE_PROPORTIONAL option. There was a bug that prevented scenes from
 affine transforming properly with respect to the director instance.

Separated CAAT compilation results into two separate versions one for Canvas/GL and the
 other for CSS. This is needed since the Actor,ActorContainer,Scene and Director classes
 have been rewritten to support a CSS renderer. Since there's a extend function invoked
 inside closures to extend prototypes I'm unable to decide on the fly whether to extends
 an object (Actor) or another version with the same interface (ActorCSS).


09/08/2011
----------

Actor.cacheAsBitmap method change: now returns this instead of an HTMLCanvasElement.

Set ScaleBehavior and RotateBehavior setAnchor method to define an exact pixel distance
anchor. Use this method when setting percentages via setValues method call is hard to do,
for example, when anchoring around a parent.


08/06/2011
----------

Added getRenderType method to Director. It will return WEBGL|CANVAS|CSS depending
on the rendering techniques it uses.

Added DirectorCSS, SceneCSS and ActorCSS to the system. Now, CSS is a suitable option
to render.

Added CSS renderer.

DOM is unable to identify wihch of any overlapping divs the user is interacting with.
 Added a over div which tracks mouse info. ( And works properly \o/ )

CSS Renderer drawbacks:
    * the scale anchor's been deprecated since transform style only supports one
    * always use accessor/mutator method to interact with actor's properties
    * unable to use dynamic images (ie Canvas generated images).

Changed Scale Anchor semantics. Now it is equal to Rotation, so the method
setScaleAnchored now accept two more parameters which define the position in pixels
where the anchor is located.

Changed ScaleBehavior and RotateBehavior to fit the new setScale semantics. Now the method
setValues of these Behavior accept two more parameters to define the transformation anchor.

In general, there should not be mixed different types of director renderers per page.


07/30/2011
----------

CAAT.Actor: added the capability to draw images on its background. This feature
 will substitute the need of using CAAT.ImageActor, CAAT.Image and CAAT.Button.

CAAT.CompoundImage: added method to automatically change sprite index on time
 basis. Basically logic from SpriteActor's been moved to this class.

Created CAAT.SpriteImage to substitute CAAT.CompoundImage and serve as images
info backend for CAAT.Actor.  CAAT.CompoundImage is kept for backwards compatibility
with CAAT.ImageActor, CAAT.SpriteActor and CAAT.Button.

Modified GL methods to kept compatibility with new CAAT.Actor image capabilities.
