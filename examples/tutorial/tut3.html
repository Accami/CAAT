    <h1>CAAT.Actor</h1>
    <p>CAAT.Actor is the simplest object instance that will be drawn on screen.</p>
    <p>This object contains default functionality for</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set position on screen. In fact, as we've already seen on previous chapters, set position on the Director Canvas.</li>
        <li>Set Size</li>
        <li>Set affine transforms (rotation, scale and translation)</li>
        <li>Compose transformations. A container Actor will transform its children before they apply their own transformation.</li>
        <li>Enable clipping</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>One important fact about Actors is the coordinate system. An Actor will always report local coordinates
    despite the transformation applied to it. In example, an Actor can be scales twice in width, and rotated
    45 degrees, and on mouseMove the received event will report local Actor coordinates as if it weren't transformed.</p>
    <p>An Actor by itself won't display on screen. The correct hierarchy to be defined is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Create a Director</li>
        <li>Create a Scene</li>
        <li>Add at least one Scene to the Director</li>
        <li>Add Actor instances to the Scene</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's start by understanding the elements of the hierarchy and their API from top down, that's it, from the
    Director to simple Actors.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h1>Mouse Events</h1>
        <p>In normal conditions an Actor has mouse events enabled by default. The mouse control methods are the following:</p>
        <ul>
		    <li><strong>mouseEnter</strong><br>Triggered whenever the mouse enters the rectangular area of an Actor. The Actor can
            be transformed by rotations and scales. That means that CAAT will perform perfect pixel collision detection
            so the mouse arrow must be inside the contour of the Actor despite the transformation applied to id.</li>
		    <li><strong>mouseExit</strong><br>Exactly like in mouseEnter, but when leaving the Actors contour.</li>
		    <li><strong>mouseMove</strong><br>Triggered whenever the mouse arrow traverses inside the Actor's contour.</li>
		    <li><strong>mouseDown</strong><br>Triggered whenever we press the mouse button inside the Actor's contour.</li>
		    <li><strong>mouseUp</strong><br>Same as mouseDown but when releasing the mouse button.</li>
            <li><strong>mouseClick</strong><br>Triggered whenever a click has been generated on the Actor. That means
            that previously a mouseDown and then a mouseDown have been triggered on the Actor.</li>
            <li><strong>mouseDblClick</strong><br>Same as mouseClick but double click.</li>
		    <li><strong>mouseDrag</strong><br>Triggered after we perform an equivalent to mouseMove after having done mouseDown.
            After dragging, when releasing the mouse button, only mouseUp will be triggered avoiding to trigger
            mouseClick event.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these methods receive a unique parameter of type CAAT.MouseEvent. It contains the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>screenPoint</b><br>The 2D point of the screen coordinate that originated the mouse event.</li>
            <li><b>point</b><br>The 2D point of local Actor coordinates. Remember that local coordinates are from (0,0) to actor's
                (width,height). These 2D point is derived from the screenPoint.</li>
            <li><b>modifiers</b><br>Modifiers will tell you whether some special keys where pressed during the mouse input. The
            CAAT.MouseEvent class has some methods to check for these special keys.</li>
            <li><b>time</b><br>The Scene time (more on this later) at which the event was produced.</li>
            <li><b>source</b><br>The actor the event was produced at.</li>
        </ul>
