CAAT.Actor: added the capability to draw images on its background. This feature
 will substitute the need of using CAAT.ImageActor, CAAT.Image and CAAT.Button.

CAAT.CompoundImage: added method to automatically change sprite index on time
 basis. Basically logic from SpriteActor's been moved to this class.

Created CAAT.SpriteImage to substitute CAAT.CompoundImage and serve as images
info backend for CAAT.Actor.  CAAT.CompoundImage is kept for backwards compatibility
with CAAT.ImageActor, CAAT.SpriteActor and CAAT.Button.

Modified GL methods to kept compatibility with new CAAT.Actor image capabilities.

Added getRenderType method to Director. It will return WEBGL|CANVAS|CSS depending
on the rendering techniques it uses.

Added DirectorCSS, SceneCSS and ActorCSS to the system. Now, CSS is a suitable option
to render.

Added CSS renderer.

DOM is unable to identify wihch of any overlapping divs the user is interacting with.
 Added a over div which tracks mouse info. ( And works properly \o/ )

CSS Renderer drawbacks:
    * the scale anchor's been deprecated since transform style only supports one
    * always use accessor/mutator method to interact with actor's properties
    * unable to use dynamic images (ie Canvas generated images).

Changed Scale Anchor semantics. Now it is equal to Rotation, so the method
setScaleAnchored now accept two more parameters which define the position in pixels
where the anchor is located.

Changed ScaleBehavior and RotateBehavior to fit the new setScale semantics. Now the method
setValues of these Behavior accept two more parameters to define the transformation anchor.

In general, there should not be mixed different types of director renderers per page.

Actor.cacheAsBitmap method change: now returns this instead of an HTMLCanvasElement.

Set ScaleBehavior and RotateBehavior setAnchor method to define an exact pixel distance
anchor. Use this method when setting percentages via setValues method call is hard to do,
for example, when anchoring around a parent.
