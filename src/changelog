CAAT.Actor: added the capability to draw images on its background. This feature
 will substitute the need of using CAAT.ImageActor, CAAT.Image and CAAT.Button.

CAAT.CompoundImage: added method to automatically change sprite index on time
 basis. Basically logic from SpriteActor's been moved to this class.

Created CAAT.SpriteImage to substitute CAAT.CompoundImage and serve as images
info backend for CAAT.Actor.  CAAT.CompoundImage is kept for backwards compatibility
with CAAT.ImageActor, CAAT.SpriteActor and CAAT.Button.

Modified GL methods to kept compatibility with new CAAT.Actor image capabilities.
